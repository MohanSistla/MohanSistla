# Hello All

I'm Mohan Sistla and I'm an Aspiring Data Scientist. I worked as a software engineer for 2 years prior to pursuing my Masters in Analytics from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I'm really passionate about leveraging data to draw key insights which has great potential to drive businesses to great heights. Thus, I have been able to hone my skills in the area of Applied Statistics, R and Python Programming, SQL and Database design, Machine learning and Time Series models and Data Visualisation. Apart from that I take great interest in the area of Ecomonetrics and its application in drawing causal inferences between 2 experiments.
