# Hello All

I'm Mohan Sistla and I'm an Aspiring Data Scientist. I worked as a software engineer for 2 years prior to pursuing my Masters in Analytics from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.
I have been working on Statistics and Machine Learning since 3 years and I plan to extend my career in this direction. 

Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin as well.
